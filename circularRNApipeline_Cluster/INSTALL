1. Download most recent version of code. You will only need 1 of these 2 directories
and can delete the other which you will not be using:
  
  circularRNApipeline_Cluster for running on cluster using Sun Grid Engine or SLURM scheduler
  circularRNApipeline_StandAlone for running on a single machine
  
2. make sure circularRNApipeline_*/analysis/predictJunctions_tableData.r is executable

   chmod a+x predictJunctions_tableData.r
  
3. Install the following software and add to $PATH

    Bowtie2 2.2.1+ (tested with 2.2.1)
    Bowtie 0.12.7+ (tested with 0.12.7)
    perl
    python 2.7.3+ (tested with 2.7.5) and the numpy and scipy libraries
    R 3.0.2+ (tested with 3.0.2) and the data.table package
    samtools 1.2+ if you want alignment files output as bam instead of sam files
    
4. Install bowtie indexes:

Annotated junction indices are available for Human (hg19), Mouse (mm10), Rat (rn5) and Drosophila (dm3).
We have also packaged up all of the the transcriptome, genome, and ribosomal index, fasta, and gtf files
for each of these genomes named as required for use with our scripts. You will need to create an index directory
under the top level circularRNApipeline directory and unpack the Bowtie2 tar (use: tar zxvf genomeId_BT2index.tar.gz)
and the fastas tar (use: tar zxvf genomeId_fastas.tar.gz) into this index directory. You will need to create
another index directory under circularRNApipeline/denovo_scripts and unpack the Bowtie1 tar
(use: tar zxvf genomeId_BT1index.tar.gz) into this index directory. The gtf file must be downloaded
and uncompressed (gunzip genomeId_genes.gtf.gz) into the circularRNApipeline/denovo_scripts directory.

5. Follow directions in testOutput/README to test installation.
