Fastq files are provided with release v1.1. This is a single sample with paired end 
read data from a human sample. I downloaded the raw reads from SRA and used TrimGalore 
(wrapper for cutadapt) to trim poor quality ends and adapter sequence. The original reads 
were 60nt, for the files included here I kept all reads where both mates were at least 50nt 
after trimming. The fastq files use phred64 encoding.

Other files not mentioned below are created when you run KNIFE on this sample, but these 
are the main output files of interest to confirm at each step. Note that glmReport, report, 
and sampleStats files might not exactly match results provided in testOutput due to slight
differences in software versions but the results should be close.

1. cd into directory containing findCircularRNA.sh

2. To find annotated linear and circular junctions, run the following command after
replacing READ_DIRECTORY with the absolute path to the directory containing the
test fq.gz files and OUTPUT_DIRECTORY with the absolute path to the directory
where you want the output. All other parameters should be left as is, they were
determined as outlined in the project README to be appropriate for this dataset. 
 
Running on cluster: sh findCircularRNA.sh READ_DIRECTORY complete OUTPUT_DIRECTORY testData 8 sam_large_phred64 circReads 40

Running on single machine: sh completeRun.sh READ_DIRECTORY complete OUTPUT_DIRECTORY testData 8 phred64 circReads 40 2>&1 | tee out.log

3. Confirm output: 

a) OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/circReads/glmReports contains SRR1027187_1__linearJuncProbs.txt
and SRR1027187_1__circJuncProbs.txt

b) OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/sampleStats contains SampleAlignStats.txt and SampleCircStats.txt

c) denovo index was created: 6 bowtie2 index files named denovo_testData* and
denovo_testData_onlycircles1.fa were generated in CODE_DIRECTORY/denovo_scripts/.

4. To align to the denovo index and find unannotated circular junctions, run the
following command, with READ_DIRECTORY and OUTPUT_DIRECTORY matching what you used
in step 2.

Running on cluster: sh findCircularRNA.sh READ_DIRECTORY complete OUTPUT_DIRECTORY testData 8 sam_large_phred64_unaligned circReads 40

Running on single machine: skip to next step, everything was already run in the call above to completeRun.sh

5. Confirm denovo output:

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/circReads/reports/unaligned_SRR1027187_1_denovo_report.txt
