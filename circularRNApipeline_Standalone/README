** Before attempting to run, make sure you have the Bowtie2 index files for your species 
in circularRNApipeline_Standalone/index, the Bowtie1 index files in 
circularRNApipeline_Standalone/denovo_scripts/index, and the gtf file in 
circularRNApipeline_Standalone/denovo_scripts (see main project README for details).

** You must cd into circularRNApipeline_Standalone and run the script completeRun.sh
from within the directory so that all relative paths will work.

** There are a total of 10 possible parameters, the first 5 are required and
defaults for the rest are described in the main project README. Keep in mind that since this is a
shell script the arguments are positional. This means that if you wanted to use
default value for argument 6 but wanted to specify a different value for
parameter 7, you still need to call the script with the default value for
argument 6 specified.

** see README on main project page for details on each of these parameters
