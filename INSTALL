1. Download most recent version of code. You will only need 1 of these 3 directories
and can delete the other 2 which you will no be using:
  
  circularRNApipeline_SGE for Sun Grid Engine
  circularRNApipeline_SLURM for SLURM
  circularRNApipeline_StandAlone for running on a single machine. 

2. For SLURM or SGE versions, edit the following files to load appropriate modules at runtime: 
   circularRNApipeline_*/analysis/depends_bam.sh needs to load samtools version 1.2+
   circularRNApipeline_*/analysis/depends_bt2.sh needs to load Bowtie2 2.2.1+ (tested with 2.2.1)
   circularRNApipeline_*/analysis/depends_python.sh needs to load python 2.7.5+ (tested with 2.7.5) with numpy and scipy libaries
   circularRNApipeline_*/analysis/depends_r.sh needs to load R (tested with 3.0.2) which has data.table package installed
   circularRNApipeline_*/denovo_scripts/depends_bt1.sh needs to load Bowtie1 (tested with 0.12.7)
   if perl is not available by default, circularRNApipeline_*/denovo_scripts/denovo_scripts.batch needs to load perl

   For the StandAlone version, the required software listed above must be available in $PATH at runtime
   
3. Install bowtie indexes:

Annotated junction indices are available for Human (hg19), Mouse (mm10), Rat (rn5) and Drosophila (dm3).
We have also packaged up all of the the transcriptome, genome, and ribosomal index, fasta, and gtf files
for each of these genomes named as required for use with our scripts. You will need to create an index directory
under the top level circularRNApipeline directory and unpack the Bowtie2 tar (use: tar zxvf genomeId_BT2index.tar.gz)
and the fastas tar (use: tar zxvf genomeId_fastas.tar.gz) into this index directory. You will need to create
another index directory under circularRNApipeline/denovo_scripts and unpack the Bowtie1 tar
(use: tar zxvf genomeId_BT1index.tar.gz) into this index directory. The gtf file must be downloaded
and uncompressed (gunzip genomeId_genes.gtf.gz) into the circularRNApipeline/denovo_scripts directory.

4. Follow directions in testOutput/README to test installation.
