To install KNIFE for use on a cluster running SGE or SLURM scheduler:

1. Download most recent version of code. You will be using code under circularRNApipeline_SGE
for Sun Grid Engine, or circularRNApipeline_SLURM for SLURM, and can delete the directory
for the other scheduler. 

2. Edit the following files to load appropriate modules at runtime: 
   circularRNApipeline_*/analysis/depends_bam.sh needs to load samtools version 1.2+
   circularRNApipeline_*/analysis/depends_bt2.sh needs to load Bowtie2 2.2.1+ (tested with 2.2.1)
   circularRNApipeline_*/analysis/depends_python.sh needs to load python 2.7.5+ (tested with 2.7.5) with numpy and scipy libaries
   circularRNApipeline_*/analysis/depends_r.sh needs to load R (tested with 3.0.2) which has data.table package installed
   circularRNApipeline_*/denovo_scripts/depends_bt1.sh needs to load Bowtie1 (tested with 0.12.7)
   if perl is not available by default, circularRNApipeline_*/denovo_scripts/denovo_scripts.batch needs to load perl
   
3. Install bowtie indexes by following instructions in the README for "Using Available Genomes"

4. Follow directions in testOutput/README to test installation.
